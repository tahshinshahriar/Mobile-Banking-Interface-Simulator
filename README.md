# Mobile-Banking-Interface-Simulator
Mobile Banking System Simulator is a password protected system that enables users to check account balance, deposit, withdraw, and send money. It uses SQL databases to keep track of user data. The project employs a range of appropriate data structures to analyze the user database and maximize the system's efficiency. I have received part help with the code from Nidhi Biswas.
